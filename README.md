### Additional Re-Analysis for GSE5859 Data Commonly Used for Studying Batch Effects in HarvardX PH525.4x

Analysis of the data provided for the edX course is at the top-level.

Analysis starting from the raw .CEL files (from [GSE5859](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE5859)) are within the [Re-Analysis](https://github.com/cwarden45/edX_plus_GEO-Spielman_et_al_2007_Re-Analysis/tree/main/Re-Analysis) subfolder.

If registered for the course (which I believe you can still do for free, if not getting a certificate), then you can see the Discussion Post [here](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+PH525.4x+3T2020/discussion/forum/i4x-HSPH-PH525.4x-course-2016_Spring/threads/61cf7269b38ee505b603681a).
